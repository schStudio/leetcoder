The repository is built to record my experience in leetcode.com

I built this repository to record my programming experience in leetcode.com.
leetcode.com is a great website for trainning both thinking of solving problems and coding skills,
and I, as a programmer, will try my best to work out every problem in leetcode.com

For every problem, I will write down my thinking process, which comes from my brain or others' brain,
and of course, I will paste my code also.

Let's become a leetcoder!!!
